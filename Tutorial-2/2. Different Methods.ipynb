    "### Instance Methods\n",
    "The first method on `MyClass`, called `method`, is a regular instance method. That’s the basic, no-frills method type you’ll use most of the time. You can see the method takes one parameter, `self`, which points to an instance of `MyClass` when the method is called (but of course instance methods can accept more than just one parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the `self` parameter, instance methods can freely access attributes and other methods on the same object. This gives them a lot of power when it comes to modifying an object’s state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only can they modify object state, instance methods can also access the class itself through the `self.__class__` attribute. This means instance methods can also modify class state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Methods\n",
    "Let’s compare that to the second method, `MyClass.classmethod`. I marked this method with a `@classmethod` decorator to flag it as a class method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of accepting a `self` parameter, class methods take a `cls` parameter that points to the class—and not the object instance—when the method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the class method only has access to this `cls` argument, **it can’t modify object instance state**. That would require access to `self`. However, class methods can still modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Methods\n",
    "The third method,` MyClass.staticmethod` was marked with a `@staticmethod` decorator to flag it as a static method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of method takes neither a `self` nor a `cls` parameter (but of course it’s free to accept an arbitrary number of other parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore a static method can **neither modify object state nor class state**. Static methods are restricted in what data they can access - and they’re primarily a way to namespace your methods."

    "As we’ve learned, static methods can’t access class or instance state because they don’t take a `cls` or `self` argument. That’s a big limitation — but it’s also a great signal to show that a particular method is independent from everything else around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, it’s clear that `circle_area()` can’t modify the class or the class instance in any way. (Sure, you could always work around that with a global variable but that’s not the point here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why is that useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flagging a method as a static method is not just a hint that a method won’t modify class or instance state — this restriction is also enforced by the Python runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques like that allow you to communicate clearly about parts of your class architecture so that new development work is naturally guided to happen within these set boundaries. Of course, it would be easy enough to defy these restrictions. But in practice they often help avoid accidental modifications going against the original design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently, using static methods and class methods are ways to communicate developer intent while enforcing that intent enough to avoid most slip of the mind mistakes and bugs that would break the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied sparingly and when it makes sense, writing some of your methods that way can provide maintenance benefits and make it less likely that other developers use your classes incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods also have benefits when it comes to writing test code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the `circle_area()` method is completely independent from the rest of the class it’s much easier to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t have to worry about setting up a complete class instance before we can test the method in a unit test. We can just fire away like we would testing a regular function. Again, this makes future maintenance easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Instance methods need a class instance and can access the instance through `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class methods don’t need a class instance. They can’t access the instance (`self`) but they have access to the class itself via `cls`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Static methods don’t have access to `cls` or `self`. They work like regular functions but belong to the class’s namespace.\n",
