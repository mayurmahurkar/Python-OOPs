    "In the first lesson we  learned how to create a simple class and how to create instances of that class. We learned a lot about intsnace variables which are used for data that is uniue to each instance. So instance variables are set using the `self` argument. For example in the `Employee` class that we created we set the name, the email and the pay in our `__init__` method and those are set for each instance of the employee that we create. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, class variables are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. So while instance variables can be unique for each instance like our name, email and pay; class variables should be the same for each instance. "
